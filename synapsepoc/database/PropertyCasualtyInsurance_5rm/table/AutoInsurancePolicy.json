		"Description": "Insurance designed to protect against losses involving automobiles. All types of policies, including basic liability, collision and comprehensive, etc. come together to constitute automobile insurance.\n\nPersonal Auto Policy: The most common auto insurance policy sold today. Often referred to as \"PAP,\" this policy is written in simple wording and provides coverage for liability, medical payments, uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, and physical damage protection.\n\nAUTO INSURANCE POLICY\nThere are basically six different types of coverages. Some may be required by law. Others are optional. They are:\n\n1. Bodily injury liability, for injuries the policyholder causes to someone else.\n\n2. Medical payments or Personal Injury Protection (PIP) for treatment of injuries to the driver and passengers of the policyholder's car.\n\n3. Property damage liability, for damage the policyholder causes to someone else's property.\n\n4. Collision, for damage to the policyholder's car from a collision.\n\n5. Comprehensive, for damage to the policyholder's car not involving a collision with another car (including damage from fire, explosions, earthquakes, floods, and riots), and theft.\n\n6. Uninsured motorists coverage, for costs resulting from an accident involving a hit-and-run driver or a driver who does not have insurance.\n\nA specific type(s) of insurance coverage associated with an insurance policy.\n\nEx:\nLIABILITY\n- Bodily injury\n- First Aid Expenses\n- Damage To Other Vehicles\n- Court Costs\n- Other Property Damage\nMEDICAL EXPENSES\n- Hospital Expenses\n- Ambulance Fees\n- Physician Services\n- Funeral Expenses\nCOMPREHENSIVE\n- Theft\n- Fire\n- Vandalism\n- Collision with Animals\n- Falling Objects\n- Glass Breakage\n- Flood\n- Hail\n- Windstorm\nCOLLISION\n- Other Vehicles\n- Stationary Objects\n- Upset\n- While Parked\nUNINSURED MOTORIST\n- Riding in your vehicle\n- Property Damage\nOTHER \n- Newly Acquired Vehicle\n- Emergency Road Service\n- Auto Rental Reimbursement\n- Accidental Death and Dismemberment\n- Combined Single Limit\n- Drive-Other-Car (Endorsement)\n- Extended Non-Lower Liability\n\nwhere:\n\nAuto insurance coverage is packaged into different coverage types. It is usually easiest to determine what you are required to purchase. Then, you determine what you have that needs to be protected. You purchase insurance to protect yourself (your family) in the event that you suffer a loss to your person or property and you purchase insurance to protect yourself (your family) from losses suffered by others. Below is a breakdown of each car insurance coverage type to help you understand more about what each type of coverage protects. Next to each type is a term that is usually associated with that coverage type.\n\nLIABILITY COVERAGE (LIABILITY)\nBODILY INJURY LIABILITY \nCovers other people's bodily injuries or death for which you are responsible. It also provides for a legal defense if another party in the accident files a lawsuit against you. Claims for bodily injury may be for such things as medical bills, loss of income or pain and suffering. In the event of a serious accident, you want enough insurance to cover a judgment against you in a lawsuit, without jeopardizing your personal assets. Bodily injury liability covers injury to people, not your vehicle. Therefore, it is a good idea (and usually a company requirement) to have the same level of coverage for all of your cars. Bodily Injury Liability does NOT cover you or other people on your policy. Coverage is limited to the terms and conditions contained in the policy. It is mandatory in most states.\n\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\nThe dual coverage limits refer to the maximum amounts that will be paid per person, per incident, respectively.\n\nEssential things to keep in mind when selecting your Bodily Injury limits:\nIf you select limits that are too low, you could be putting yourself at risk financially. \n\nFor example, if either you or a driver covered by your policy cause a serious injury where damages exceed your limits, you will be held responsible for the amount above your limits. To make that payment, you could be forced to liquidate property, savings, and other assets, or your future earnings could be attached. By purchasing liability limits to account for both your current assets and future net worth, you can help protect yourself against this risk.\n\nPROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY \nCovers you if your car damages someone else's property. Usually it is their car, but it could be a fence, a house or any other property damaged in an accident. It also provides you with legal defense if another party files a lawsuit against you. It is a good idea to purchase enough of this insurance to cover the amount of damage your car might do to another vehicle or object. Coverage is limited to the terms and conditions contained in the policy.\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\n\nThe coverage limits refer to the maximum amounts that will be paid per accident.\n\nEssential things to keep in mind when selecting your Property Damage limits:\nIf you select limits that are too low, you could be putting yourself at risk financially. For example, if either you or a driver covered by your policy cause a serious accident where damages exceed your limits, you will be held responsible for the amount above your limits. To make that payment, you could be forced to liquidate property, savings, and other assets, or your future earnings could be attached. By purchasing liability limits to account for both your current assets and future net worth, you can help protect yourself against this risk.\n\nPHYSICAL DAMAGE COVERAGE (COMP AND COLL)\nCOMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE (OTHER THAN COLLISION, OTC, COMP):\nCovers your vehicle, and other vehicles (in limited scenarios) you may be driving for losses resulting from incidents other than collision. For example, comprehensive insurance covers damage to your car if it is stolen; or damaged by flood, fire, or animals. It pays to fix your vehicle less the deductible you choose. To keep your premiums low, select as high a deductible as you feel comfortable paying out of pocket. Coverage is limited to the terms and conditions contained in the policy. This is not required by a state, but if you have a loan or a lease then the lien holder will require it.\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\n\nThe amount you see typically refers to the deductible, or the portion of a claim you are responsible for paying.\n\nA higher deductible can substantially lower the cost of insurance premiums. You should balance this savings against your ability to absorb a larger out-of-pocket expense. \n\nFor example, if you set your deductible at $1,000 and your car sustains damages totaling $1,500, you will pay $1,000 and your insurance company will pay $500.\n\nWho might benefit from buying Comprehensive coverage?\n- If your car is financed or leased, the finance company will probably require that you carry this coverage.\n- If you have a newer vehicle or one in excellent condition, you may need this coverage to replace or repair the vehicle in case of loss.\n- If you have an older car or one in poor condition, you may not want to pay for this coverage.\n\nCOLLISION COVERAGE \nCovers damage to your car when your car hits, or is hit by, another vehicle, or other object. Pays to fix your vehicle less the deductible you choose. To keep your premiums low, select as large a deductible as you feel comfortable paying out of pocket. For older cars, consider dropping this coverage, since coverage is normally limited to the cash value of your car. Coverage is limited to the terms and conditions contained in the policy. This is not required by a state, but if you have a loan or a lease then the lien holder will require it.\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\n\nThe amount you see typically refers to the deductible, or the portion of a claim that you're responsible for paying.\n\nA higher deductible can substantially lower the cost of insurance premiums. You should balance this savings against your ability to absorb a larger out-of-pocket expense.\n\nFor example, if you set your deductible at $1,000 and your car sustains damages totaling $1,500, you will pay $1,000 and your insurance company will pay $500.\n\nWho might benefit from buying Collision coverage?\n- If your car is financed or leased, the finance company will probably require that you carry this coverage.\n- If you have a newer vehicle or one in excellent condition, you may need this coverage to replace or repair the vehicle in case of loss.\n- If you have an older car or one in poor condition, you may not want to pay for this coverage.\n\nUNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE (UM)\nUNINSURED MOTORIST BODILY INJURY (UM):\n\nCovers you, the insured members of your household and your passengers for bodily/personal injuries, damages, or death caused by an at-fault uninsured or hit-and-run driver. If you are involved in an accident where the other driver is at fault but has no insurance, your policy will cover your medical expenses, up to the limit on your policy.\n\nWho is covered?\n\n- Policyholder\n- Other drivers covered by the policy\n- Passengers\n\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\nIf the other driver involved in an accident is uninsured, this coverage pays up to the limit you purchase. The coverage limits refer to the maximum amount that will be paid per person, per incident, respectively.\nWho might benefit from buying uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage?\nIndividuals without health insurance may benefit from this coverage, because if the limits chosen are inadequate, you will be responsible for paying the additional amount.\n\nUNDERINSURED MOTORIST BODILY INJURY (UNDUM):\nCovers you, the insured members of your household and your passengers for injuries, damages or death caused by the negligence of a person with insufficient insurance. If you have an accident with a person whose coverage cannot meet your damages, your policy will meet the difference-up to the limit of liability listed on your policy.\n\nWho is covered?\n- Policyholder\n- Other drivers covered by the policy\n- Passengers\n\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\nIf the other driver involved in an accident is underinsured, this coverage typically pays any difference between what the other driver's insurance covers and what your bodily injury coverage will pay. The coverage limits refer to the maximum amount that will be paid per person, per incident, respectively. If the limits you purchase are lower than an accident's costs, you'll be responsible for paying the amounts over your limits, unless you're covered by health insurance.\n\nWho might benefit from buying uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage?\nIndividuals without health insurance may benefit from this coverage, because if the limits chosen are inadequate, you will be responsible for paying the additional amount.\n\nBoth UM and UNDUM coverage can be combined or sold separately depending on the state and the insurance carrier.\n\nUNINSURED PROPERTY DAMAGE (UMPD):\nCovers your auto when property damage is sustained by an insured and the negligent operator does not possess insurance.\n\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\nIf you don't have Collision coverage, Uninsured Motorist Property Damage coverage pays up to a certain amount for repairs to the insured car (some states have limits at $3500, some are lower and some are higher). If you have Collision coverage, Uninsured Motorist Property Damage coverage only pays your Collision deductible (in some states).\n\nDoes this coverage replace Collision coverage?\nNo. Uninsured Motorist Property Damage alone is not enough to cover all potential car repair/replacement costs, and only applies if you are involved in an accident caused by a driver without insurance coverage.\n\nUNDERINSURED MOTORIST PROPERTY DAMAGE (UNDPD):\nCovers when property damage is sustained by an insured and the negligent operator possesses insurance, but the limits of liability carried by the negligent driver are not sufficient to cover the damages.\n\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\nIf you don't have Collision coverage, Underinsured Motorist Property Damage coverage pays up to a certain amount for repairs to the insured car (some states have limits at $3500, some are lower and some are higher) If you have Collision coverage, Underinsured Motorist Property Damage coverage only pays your Collision deductible (in some states).\n\nDoes this coverage replace Collision coverage?\nNo. Underinsured Motorist Property Damage alone is not enough to cover all potential car repair/replacement costs, and only applies if you are involved in an accident caused by a driver without enough liability insurance coverage.\nBoth UMPD and UNDPD coverage can be combined or sold separately depending on the state and insurance carrier.\n\nOTHER COVERAGE TYPES\n\nPERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION COVERAGE (PIP or MEDEX):\nCovers within the specified limits, the medical, hospital and funeral expenses of the insured, others in his vehicles and pedestrians struck by him. The basic coverage for the insured's own injuries on a first-party basis, without regard to fault. It is only available in certain states. Depending on the state, the covered parties below and the amount of protection may vary.\n\nWho is covered?\n- Policyholder\n- Policyholder's relatives in the same household\n- Passengers\n- Other authorized drivers\n- Policyholder and family members if they are injured while riding in someone else's car or as a pedestrian when struck by another vehicle. (in some states)\n\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\nTotal payments covered by PIP are the limits indicated. That is the maximum amount that will be paid per person for any combination of covered expenses (some states offer limits and others set it to an amount like $10,000). Specific limits and coverages vary by state.\n\nWho might benefit from buying additional medical coverage along with PIP?\nPeople who don't have health insurance that adequately covers the expenses listed above or people who carpool or frequently drive with passengers.\n\nRelated Coverage:\nAdditional Personal Injury Protection is available in some states where PIP is available; some carriers may offer Additional PIP. Additional Personal Injury Protection acts as a supplement to the PIP coverage required by your state.\nGuest Personal Injury Protection provides coverage to guest passengers in your vehicles. It is required when all drivers on your policy have rejected no-fault coverage (state of Kentucky).\n\nIn states like New Jersey, you have to choose a Personal Injury Protection Plan. Here is a description of those choices:\n Full PIP Primary- acts as the primary coverage for injuries sustained by you or your passengers in an auto accident. This option also covers income continuation, funeral expenses, death benefits, and essential services expenses, as detailed below. \n- Full PIP Health Primary- should be purchased if another health insurance provider acts as the primary coverage for injuries sustained by you or your passengers in an auto accident. This option also covers income continuation, funeral expenses, death benefits, and essential services expenses, as detailed below. Please note: Full PIP Health Primary is not available if you use Medicare or Medicaid as your primary health insurance or if you are an active member of the military. In addition, some health insurers do not cover injuries related to car accidents. If you are unsure of what your health insurance covers, you should select Full PIP Primary or Medical Only PIP Primary. \n\n- Medical Only PIP Primary- acts as the primary coverage for injuries sustained by you or your passengers in an auto accident. \n- Medical Only Health Primary- should be purchased if another health insurance provider acts as the primary coverage for injuries sustained by you or your passengers in an auto accident. Please note: Medical Only Health Primary is not available if you use Medicare or Medicaid as your primary health insurance or if you are an active member of the military. In addition, some health insurers do not cover injuries related to car accidents. If you are unsure of what your health insurance covers, you should select Full PIP Primary or Medical Only PIP Primary.\n\nBASIC AND ADDITIONAL REPARATION BENEFITS (BRP or PIP):\nBasic Reparations Benefits will cover medical up to the selected amount. In some states, Additional Reparations Benefits is available to extend additional benefits. Additional Reparations Benefits is usually primary over any Health Insurance. This coverage is optional and you cannot have Medical Payments with this coverage.\n\nFIRST PARTY BENEFITS - MEDICAL (FPB OR MEDEX):\nFirst Party Benefits cover several areas of insurance coverage; however, this definition is for First Party Benefits-Medical. Similar to medical payments coverage and Personal Injury Protection, FPB helps pay for your medical expenses if you or relatives living in your household are injured in an accident. Specific limits and coverages vary by state, but typically these services include:\n- Related medical and surgical treatment\n- Essential rehabilitative services (physical therapy, speech pathology, etc.)\n- Necessary dental, psychiatric, psychological, and optometric treatment\n- Ambulance and nursing service\n- Required medications, medical supplies, and prosthetic devices\n\nWho is covered?\nFirst Party Benefits-Medical provides coverage to the policyholder, drivers listed on the policy and relatives living in the same household as the policyholder.\n\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\n\nTotal payments covered by FPD are the limits indicated. That is the maximum amount that will be paid per person for any combination of covered expenses.\nIn addition to First Party Benefits - Medical, these coverages are available and sometimes combined as a package: First Party Benefits - Accidental Death, First Party Benefits - Combination Package, First Party Benefits - Extraordinary Medical, First Party Benefits - Funeral, and First Party Benefits - Income Loss.\n\nMEDICAL PAYMENTS (MEDPM):\nCovers medical expenses to you and your passengers injured in an accident. There may also be coverage if as a pedestrian a vehicle injures you. This coverage applies, regardless as to who is at fault. Medical Payments may also cover policyholders and their family members when they are injured while riding in someone else's car or when a car hits them while on foot or bicycling. Coverage is limited to the terms and conditions contained in the policy.\n\nWho might benefit from buying Medical Payments coverage?\nIf you and your regular passengers already have health insurance that covers similar expenses, medical payments coverage may be unnecessary. Check your health insurance policy for details.\n\nWORK LOSS:\nAlso referred to as Optional Basic Economical Loss \nThis coverage helps you, drivers listed on your policy, and your passengers recover lost wages if you are unable to work due to accident-related injuries. \n\nLOAN/LEASE GAP INSURANCE (LLG):\nAlso referred to as GAP, Loan/Lease Payoff\nLoan/Lease Gap Coverage is optional. To buy this coverage, you must have Collision coverage and Comprehensive coverage. You must have a deductible and your car must have a lien holder because it is financed or leased.\n\nThis coverage protects you if your car gets damaged and will reimburse you for the difference between the following items: \n- The actual cash value of your car at the time of the loss, less the applicable deductible and the vehicle's salvage value (if retained by the owner or insured) and;\n- Any greater amount owed on the vehicle at the time of loss, less any unpaid finance charges, excess mileage or wear and tear charges, any other charges or expenses associated with the loan or lease, and the vehicle's salvage value (if retained by the owner or insured).\nPlease follow this link to learn more about GAP Insurance. GAP insurance is usually available as a separate policy from the auto policy. It is much less expensive to purchase LLG coverage with your policy.\n\nRENTAL CAR REIMBURSEMENT (RREIM):\nCovers renting a car if your car is not drivable or while your car is being repaired because of a covered accident.\n\nTOWING AND LABOR (TL):\nAlso, referred to as Tow Club, Emergency Road Service, Emergency Roadside Service\nCoverage is only available if you purchase Comprehensive and/or Collision Coverage.

All types of policies, including basic liability, collision and comprehensive, etc. come together to constitute automobile insurance.\\n\\nPersonal Auto Policy: The most common auto insurance policy sold today. Often referred to as \\\"PAP,\\\" this policy is written in simple wording and provides coverage for liability, medical payments, uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, and physical damage protection.\\n\\nAUTO INSURANCE POLICY\\nThere are basically six different types of coverages. Some may be required by law. Others are optional. They are:\\n\\n1. Bodily injury liability, for injuries the policyholder causes to someone else.\\n\\n2. Medical payments or Personal Injury Protection (PIP) for treatment of injuries to the driver and passengers of the policyholder's car.\\n\\n3. Property damage liability, for damage the policyholder causes to someone else's property.\\n\\n4. Collision, for damage to the policyholder's car from a collision.\\n\\n5. Comprehensive, for damage to the policyholder's car not involving a collision with another car (including damage from fire, explosions, earthquakes, floods, and riots), and theft.\\n\\n6. Uninsured motorists coverage, for costs resulting from an accident involving a hit-and-run driver or a driver who does not have insurance.\\n\\nA specific type(s) of insurance coverage associated with an insurance policy.\\n\\nEx:\\nLIABILITY\\n- Bodily injury\\n- First Aid Expenses\\n- Damage To Other Vehicles\\n- Court Costs\\n- Other Property Damage\\nMEDICAL EXPENSES\\n- Hospital Expenses\\n- Ambulance Fees\\n- Physician Services\\n- Funeral Expenses\\nCOMPREHENSIVE\\n- Theft\\n- Fire\\n- Vandalism\\n- Collision with Animals\\n- Falling Objects\\n- Glass Breakage\\n- Flood\\n- Hail\\n- Windstorm\\nCOLLISION\\n- Other Vehicles\\n- Stationary Objects\\n- Upset\\n- While Parked\\nUNINSURED MOTORIST\\n- Riding in your vehicle\\n- Property Damage\\nOTHER \\n- Newly Acquired Vehicle\\n- Emergency Road Service\\n- Auto Rental Reimbursement\\n- Accidental Death and Dismemberment\\n- Combined Single Limit\\n- Drive-Other-Car (Endorsement)\\n- Extended Non-Lower Liability\\n\\nwhere:\\n\\nAuto insurance coverage is packaged into different coverage types. It is usually easiest to determine what you are required to purchase. Then, you determine what you have that needs to be protected. You purchase insurance to protect yourself (your family) in the event that you suffer a loss to your person or property and you purchase insurance to protect yourself (your family) from losses suffered by others. Below is a breakdown of each car insurance coverage type to help you understand more about what each type of coverage protects. Next to each type is a term that is usually associated with that coverage type.\\n\\nLIABILITY COVERAGE (LIABILITY)\\nBODILY INJURY LIABILITY \\nCovers other people's bodily injuries or death for which you are responsible. It also provides for a legal defense if another party in the accident files a lawsuit against you. Claims for bodily injury may be for such things as medical bills, loss of income or pain and suffering. In the event of a serious accident, you want enough insurance to cover a judgment against you in a lawsuit, without jeopardizing your personal assets. Bodily injury liability covers injury to people, not your vehicle. Therefore, it is a good idea (and usually a company requirement) to have the same level of coverage for all of your cars. Bodily Injury Liability does NOT cover you or other people on your policy. Coverage is limited to the terms and conditions contained in the policy. It is mandatory in most states.\\n\\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\\nThe dual coverage limits refer to the maximum amounts that will be paid per person, per incident, respectively.\\n\\nEssential things to keep in mind when selecting your Bodily Injury limits:\\nIf you select limits that are too low, you could be putting yourself at risk financially. \\n\\nFor example, if either you or a driver covered by your policy cause a serious injury where damages exceed your limits, you will be held responsible for the amount above your limits. To make that payment, you could be forced to liquidate property, savings, and other assets, or your future earnings could be attached. By purchasing liability limits to account for both your current assets and future net worth, you can help protect yourself against this risk.\\n\\nPROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY \\nCovers you if your car damages someone else's property. Usually it is their car, but it could be a fence, a house or any other property damaged in an accident. It also provides you with legal defense if another party files a lawsuit against you. It is a good idea to purchase enough of this insurance to cover the amount of damage your car might do to another vehicle or object. Coverage is limited to the terms and conditions contained in the policy.\\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\\n\\nThe coverage limits refer to the maximum amounts that will be paid per accident.\\n\\nEssential things to keep in mind when selecting your Property Damage limits:\\nIf you select limits that are too low, you could be putting yourself at risk financially. For example, if either you or a driver covered by your policy cause a serious accident where damages exceed your limits, you will be held responsible for the amount above your limits. To make that payment, you could be forced to liquidate property, savings, and other assets, or your future earnings could be attached. By purchasing liability limits to account for both your current assets and future net worth, you can help protect yourself against this risk.\\n\\nPHYSICAL DAMAGE COVERAGE (COMP AND COLL)\\nCOMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE (OTHER THAN COLLISION, OTC, COMP):\\nCovers your vehicle, and other vehicles (in limited scenarios) you may be driving for losses resulting from incidents other than collision. For example, comprehensive insurance covers damage to your car if it is stolen; or damaged by flood, fire, or animals. It pays to fix your vehicle less the deductible you choose. To keep your premiums low, select as high a deductible as you feel comfortable paying out of pocket. Coverage is limited to the terms and conditions contained in the policy. This is not required by a state, but if you have a loan or a lease then the lien holder will require it.\\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\\n\\nThe amount you see typically refers to the deductible, or the portion of a claim you are responsible for paying.\\n\\nA higher deductible can substantially lower the cost of insurance premiums. You should balance this savings against your ability to absorb a larger out-of-pocket expense. \\n\\nFor example, if you set your deductible at $1,000 and your car sustains damages totaling $1,500, you will pay $1,000 and your insurance company will pay $500.\\n\\nWho might benefit from buying Comprehensive coverage?\\n- If your car is financed or leased, the finance company will probably require that you carry this coverage.\\n- If you have a newer vehicle or one in excellent condition, you may need this coverage to replace or repair the vehicle in case of loss.\\n- If you have an older car or one in poor condition, you may not want to pay for this coverage.\\n\\nCOLLISION COVERAGE \\nCovers damage to your car when your car hits, or is hit by, another vehicle, or other object. Pays to fix your vehicle less the deductible you choose. To keep your premiums low, select as large a deductible as you feel comfortable paying out of pocket. For older cars, consider dropping this coverage, since coverage is normally limited to the cash value of your car. Coverage is limited to the terms and conditions contained in the policy. This is not required by a state, but if you have a loan or a lease then the lien holder will require it.\\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\\n\\nThe amount you see typically refers to the deductible, or the portion of a claim that you're responsible for paying.\\n\\nA higher deductible can substantially lower the cost of insurance premiums.

If you are involved in an accident where the other driver is at fault but has no insurance, your policy will cover your medical expenses, up to the limit on your policy.\\n\\nWho is covered?\\n\\n- Policyholder\\n- Other drivers covered by the policy\\n- Passengers\\n\\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\\nIf the other driver involved in an accident is uninsured, this coverage pays up to the limit you purchase. The coverage limits refer to the maximum amount that will be paid per person, per incident, respectively.\\nWho might benefit from buying uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage?\\nIndividuals without health insurance may benefit from this coverage, because if the limits chosen are inadequate, you will be responsible for paying the additional amount.\\n\\nUNDERINSURED MOTORIST BODILY INJURY (UNDUM):\\nCovers you, the insured members of your household and your passengers for injuries, damages or death caused by the negligence of a person with insufficient insurance. If you have an accident with a person whose coverage cannot meet your damages, your policy will meet the difference-up to the limit of liability listed on your policy.\\n\\nWho is covered?\\n- Policyholder\\n- Other drivers covered by the policy\\n- Passengers\\n\\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\\nIf the other driver involved in an accident is underinsured, this coverage typically pays any difference between what the other driver's insurance covers and what your bodily injury coverage will pay. The coverage limits refer to the maximum amount that will be paid per person, per incident, respectively. If the limits you purchase are lower than an accident's costs, you'll be responsible for paying the amounts over your limits, unless you're covered by health insurance.\\n\\nWho might benefit from buying uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage?\\nIndividuals without health insurance may benefit from this coverage, because if the limits chosen are inadequate, you will be responsible for paying the additional amount.\\n\\nBoth UM and UNDUM coverage can be combined or sold separately depending on the state and the insurance carrier.\\n\\nUNINSURED PROPERTY DAMAGE (UMPD):\\nCovers your auto when property damage is sustained by an insured and the negligent operator does not possess insurance.\\n\\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\\nIf you don't have Collision coverage, Uninsured Motorist Property Damage coverage pays up to a certain amount for repairs to the insured car (some states have limits at $3500, some are lower and some are higher). If you have Collision coverage, Uninsured Motorist Property Damage coverage only pays your Collision deductible (in some states).\\n\\nDoes this coverage replace Collision coverage?\\nNo. Uninsured Motorist Property Damage alone is not enough to cover all potential car repair/replacement costs, and only applies if you are involved in an accident caused by a driver without insurance coverage.\\n\\nUNDERINSURED MOTORIST PROPERTY DAMAGE (UNDPD):\\nCovers when property damage is sustained by an insured and the negligent operator possesses insurance, but the limits of liability carried by the negligent driver are not sufficient to cover the damages.\\n\\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\\nIf you don't have Collision coverage, Underinsured Motorist Property Damage coverage pays up to a certain amount for repairs to the insured car (some states have limits at $3500, some are lower and some are higher) If you have Collision coverage, Underinsured Motorist Property Damage coverage only pays your Collision deductible (in some states).\\n\\nDoes this coverage replace Collision coverage?\\nNo. Underinsured Motorist Property Damage alone is not enough to cover all potential car repair/replacement costs, and only applies if you are involved in an accident caused by a driver without enough liability insurance coverage.\\nBoth UMPD and UNDPD coverage can be combined or sold separately depending on the state and insurance carrier.\\n\\nOTHER COVERAGE TYPES\\n\\nPERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION COVERAGE (PIP or MEDEX):\\nCovers within the specified limits, the medical, hospital and funeral expenses of the insured, others in his vehicles and pedestrians struck by him. The basic coverage for the insured's own injuries on a first-party basis, without regard to fault. It is only available in certain states. Depending on the state, the covered parties below and the amount of protection may vary.\\n\\nWho is covered?\\n- Policyholder\\n- Policyholder's relatives in the same household\\n- Passengers\\n- Other authorized drivers\\n- Policyholder and family members if they are injured while riding in someone else's car or as a pedestrian when struck by another vehicle. (in some states)\\n\\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\\nTotal payments covered by PIP are the limits indicated. That is the maximum amount that will be paid per person for any combination of covered expenses (some states offer limits and others set it to an amount like $10,000). Specific limits and coverages vary by state.\\n\\nWho might benefit from buying additional medical coverage along with PIP?\\nPeople who don't have health insurance that adequately covers the expenses listed above or people who carpool or frequently drive with passengers.\\n\\nRelated Coverage:\\nAdditional Personal Injury Protection is available in some states where PIP is available; some carriers may offer Additional PIP. Additional Personal Injury Protection acts as a supplement to the PIP coverage required by your state.\\nGuest Personal Injury Protection provides coverage to guest passengers in your vehicles. It is required when all drivers on your policy have rejected no-fault coverage (state of Kentucky).\\n\\nIn states like New Jersey, you have to choose a Personal Injury Protection Plan. Here is a description of those choices:\\n Full PIP Primary- acts as the primary coverage for injuries sustained by you or your passengers in an auto accident. This option also covers income continuation, funeral expenses, death benefits, and essential services expenses, as detailed below. \\n- Full PIP Health Primary- should be purchased if another health insurance provider acts as the primary coverage for injuries sustained by you or your passengers in an auto accident. This option also covers income continuation, funeral expenses, death benefits, and essential services expenses, as detailed below. Please note: Full PIP Health Primary is not available if you use Medicare or Medicaid as your primary health insurance or if you are an active member of the military. In addition, some health insurers do not cover injuries related to car accidents. If you are unsure of what your health insurance covers, you should select Full PIP Primary or Medical Only PIP Primary. \\n\\n- Medical Only PIP Primary- acts as the primary coverage for injuries sustained by you or your passengers in an auto accident. \\n- Medical Only Health Primary- should be purchased if another health insurance provider acts as the primary coverage for injuries sustained by you or your passengers in an auto accident. Please note: Medical Only Health Primary is not available if you use Medicare or Medicaid as your primary health insurance or if you are an active member of the military. In addition, some health insurers do not cover injuries related to car accidents.

This coverage is optional and you cannot have Medical Payments with this coverage.\\n\\nFIRST PARTY BENEFITS - MEDICAL (FPB OR MEDEX):\\nFirst Party Benefits cover several areas of insurance coverage; however, this definition is for First Party Benefits-Medical. Similar to medical payments coverage and Personal Injury Protection, FPB helps pay for your medical expenses if you or relatives living in your household are injured in an accident.

Coverage is limited to the terms and conditions contained in the policy.\\n\\nWho might benefit from buying Medical Payments coverage?\\nIf you and your regular passengers already have health insurance that covers similar expenses, medical payments coverage may be unnecessary. Check your health insurance policy for details.\\n\\nWORK LOSS:\\nAlso referred to as Optional Basic Economical Loss \\nThis coverage helps you, drivers listed on your policy, and your passengers recover lost wages if you are unable to work due to accident-related injuries. \\n\\nLOAN/LEASE GAP INSURANCE (LLG):\\nAlso referred to as GAP, Loan/Lease Payoff\\nLoan/Lease Gap Coverage is optional.

Defined accident medical expenses are paid directly to you without a deductible.\\nWhat is covered? \\n- Towing \\n- Tire changing \\n- Gas, oil, and water delivery \\n- Battery services \\n- Lockout services'\\n\\nHow much protection does this coverage provide? \\nThe coverage limits you see in your quote refer to the maximum amount that will be paid per incident, per term, respectively. \\n\\nPROPERTY PROTECTION INSURANCE (PPI):\\nThis is required coverage in Michigan.

			"Description": "Insurance designed to protect against losses involving automobiles. All types of policies, including basic liability, collision and comprehensive, etc. come together to constitute automobile insurance.\n\nPersonal Auto Policy: The most common auto insurance policy sold today. Often referred to as \"PAP,\" this policy is written in simple wording and provides coverage for liability, medical payments, uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, and physical damage protection.\n\nAUTO INSURANCE POLICY\nThere are basically six different types of coverages. Some may be required by law. Others are optional. They are:\n\n1. Bodily injury liability, for injuries the policyholder causes to someone else.\n\n2. Medical payments or Personal Injury Protection (PIP) for treatment of injuries to the driver and passengers of the policyholder's car.\n\n3. Property damage liability, for damage the policyholder causes to someone else's property.\n\n4. Collision, for damage to the policyholder's car from a collision.\n\n5. Comprehensive, for damage to the policyholder's car not involving a collision with another car (including damage from fire, explosions, earthquakes, floods, and riots), and theft.\n\n6. Uninsured motorists coverage, for costs resulting from an accident involving a hit-and-run driver or a driver who does not have insurance.\n\nA specific type(s) of insurance coverage associated with an insurance policy.\n\nEx:\nLIABILITY\n- Bodily injury\n- First Aid Expenses\n- Damage To Other Vehicles\n- Court Costs\n- Other Property Damage\nMEDICAL EXPENSES\n- Hospital Expenses\n- Ambulance Fees\n- Physician Services\n- Funeral Expenses\nCOMPREHENSIVE\n- Theft\n- Fire\n- Vandalism\n- Collision with Animals\n- Falling Objects\n- Glass Breakage\n- Flood\n- Hail\n- Windstorm\nCOLLISION\n- Other Vehicles\n- Stationary Objects\n- Upset\n- While Parked\nUNINSURED MOTORIST\n- Riding in your vehicle\n- Property Damage\nOTHER \n- Newly Acquired Vehicle\n- Emergency Road Service\n- Auto Rental Reimbursement\n- Accidental Death and Dismemberment\n- Combined Single Limit\n- Drive-Other-Car (Endorsement)\n- Extended Non-Lower Liability\n\nwhere:\n\nAuto insurance coverage is packaged into different coverage types. It is usually easiest to determine what you are required to purchase. Then, you determine what you have that needs to be protected. You purchase insurance to protect yourself (your family) in the event that you suffer a loss to your person or property and you purchase insurance to protect yourself (your family) from losses suffered by others. Below is a breakdown of each car insurance coverage type to help you understand more about what each type of coverage protects. Next to each type is a term that is usually associated with that coverage type.\n\nLIABILITY COVERAGE (LIABILITY)\nBODILY INJURY LIABILITY \nCovers other people's bodily injuries or death for which you are responsible. It also provides for a legal defense if another party in the accident files a lawsuit against you. Claims for bodily injury may be for such things as medical bills, loss of income or pain and suffering. In the event of a serious accident, you want enough insurance to cover a judgment against you in a lawsuit, without jeopardizing your personal assets. Bodily injury liability covers injury to people, not your vehicle. Therefore, it is a good idea (and usually a company requirement) to have the same level of coverage for all of your cars. Bodily Injury Liability does NOT cover you or other people on your policy. Coverage is limited to the terms and conditions contained in the policy. It is mandatory in most states.\n\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\nThe dual coverage limits refer to the maximum amounts that will be paid per person, per incident, respectively.\n\nEssential things to keep in mind when selecting your Bodily Injury limits:\nIf you select limits that are too low, you could be putting yourself at risk financially. \n\nFor example, if either you or a driver covered by your policy cause a serious injury where damages exceed your limits, you will be held responsible for the amount above your limits. To make that payment, you could be forced to liquidate property, savings, and other assets, or your future earnings could be attached. By purchasing liability limits to account for both your current assets and future net worth, you can help protect yourself against this risk.\n\nPROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY \nCovers you if your car damages someone else's property. Usually it is their car, but it could be a fence, a house or any other property damaged in an accident. It also provides you with legal defense if another party files a lawsuit against you. It is a good idea to purchase enough of this insurance to cover the amount of damage your car might do to another vehicle or object. Coverage is limited to the terms and conditions contained in the policy.\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\n\nThe coverage limits refer to the maximum amounts that will be paid per accident.\n\nEssential things to keep in mind when selecting your Property Damage limits:\nIf you select limits that are too low, you could be putting yourself at risk financially. For example, if either you or a driver covered by your policy cause a serious accident where damages exceed your limits, you will be held responsible for the amount above your limits. To make that payment, you could be forced to liquidate property, savings, and other assets, or your future earnings could be attached. By purchasing liability limits to account for both your current assets and future net worth, you can help protect yourself against this risk.\n\nPHYSICAL DAMAGE COVERAGE (COMP AND COLL)\nCOMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE (OTHER THAN COLLISION, OTC, COMP):\nCovers your vehicle, and other vehicles (in limited scenarios) you may be driving for losses resulting from incidents other than collision. For example, comprehensive insurance covers damage to your car if it is stolen; or damaged by flood, fire, or animals. It pays to fix your vehicle less the deductible you choose. To keep your premiums low, select as high a deductible as you feel comfortable paying out of pocket. Coverage is limited to the terms and conditions contained in the policy. This is not required by a state, but if you have a loan or a lease then the lien holder will require it.\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\n\nThe amount you see typically refers to the deductible, or the portion of a claim you are responsible for paying.\n\nA higher deductible can substantially lower the cost of insurance premiums. You should balance this savings against your ability to absorb a larger out-of-pocket expense. \n\nFor example, if you set your deductible at $1,000 and your car sustains damages totaling $1,500, you will pay $1,000 and your insurance company will pay $500.\n\nWho might benefit from buying Comprehensive coverage?\n- If your car is financed or leased, the finance company will probably require that you carry this coverage.\n- If you have a newer vehicle or one in excellent condition, you may need this coverage to replace or repair the vehicle in case of loss.\n- If you have an older car or one in poor condition, you may not want to pay for this coverage.\n\nCOLLISION COVERAGE \nCovers damage to your car when your car hits, or is hit by, another vehicle, or other object. Pays to fix your vehicle less the deductible you choose. To keep your premiums low, select as large a deductible as you feel comfortable paying out of pocket. For older cars, consider dropping this coverage, since coverage is normally limited to the cash value of your car. Coverage is limited to the terms and conditions contained in the policy. This is not required by a state, but if you have a loan or a lease then the lien holder will require it.\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\n\nThe amount you see typically refers to the deductible, or the portion of a claim that you're responsible for paying.\n\nA higher deductible can substantially lower the cost of insurance premiums.

If you are involved in an accident where the other driver is at fault but has no insurance, your policy will cover your medical expenses, up to the limit on your policy.\n\nWho is covered?\n\n- Policyholder\n- Other drivers covered by the policy\n- Passengers\n\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\nIf the other driver involved in an accident is uninsured, this coverage pays up to the limit you purchase. The coverage limits refer to the maximum amount that will be paid per person, per incident, respectively.\nWho might benefit from buying uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage?\nIndividuals without health insurance may benefit from this coverage, because if the limits chosen are inadequate, you will be responsible for paying the additional amount.\n\nUNDERINSURED MOTORIST BODILY INJURY (UNDUM):\nCovers you, the insured members of your household and your passengers for injuries, damages or death caused by the negligence of a person with insufficient insurance. If you have an accident with a person whose coverage cannot meet your damages, your policy will meet the difference-up to the limit of liability listed on your policy.\n\nWho is covered?\n- Policyholder\n- Other drivers covered by the policy\n- Passengers\n\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\nIf the other driver involved in an accident is underinsured, this coverage typically pays any difference between what the other driver's insurance covers and what your bodily injury coverage will pay. The coverage limits refer to the maximum amount that will be paid per person, per incident, respectively. If the limits you purchase are lower than an accident's costs, you'll be responsible for paying the amounts over your limits, unless you're covered by health insurance.\n\nWho might benefit from buying uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage?\nIndividuals without health insurance may benefit from this coverage, because if the limits chosen are inadequate, you will be responsible for paying the additional amount.\n\nBoth UM and UNDUM coverage can be combined or sold separately depending on the state and the insurance carrier.\n\nUNINSURED PROPERTY DAMAGE (UMPD):\nCovers your auto when property damage is sustained by an insured and the negligent operator does not possess insurance.\n\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\nIf you don't have Collision coverage, Uninsured Motorist Property Damage coverage pays up to a certain amount for repairs to the insured car (some states have limits at $3500, some are lower and some are higher). If you have Collision coverage, Uninsured Motorist Property Damage coverage only pays your Collision deductible (in some states).\n\nDoes this coverage replace Collision coverage?\nNo. Uninsured Motorist Property Damage alone is not enough to cover all potential car repair/replacement costs, and only applies if you are involved in an accident caused by a driver without insurance coverage.\n\nUNDERINSURED MOTORIST PROPERTY DAMAGE (UNDPD):\nCovers when property damage is sustained by an insured and the negligent operator possesses insurance, but the limits of liability carried by the negligent driver are not sufficient to cover the damages.\n\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\nIf you don't have Collision coverage, Underinsured Motorist Property Damage coverage pays up to a certain amount for repairs to the insured car (some states have limits at $3500, some are lower and some are higher) If you have Collision coverage, Underinsured Motorist Property Damage coverage only pays your Collision deductible (in some states).\n\nDoes this coverage replace Collision coverage?\nNo. Underinsured Motorist Property Damage alone is not enough to cover all potential car repair/replacement costs, and only applies if you are involved in an accident caused by a driver without enough liability insurance coverage.\nBoth UMPD and UNDPD coverage can be combined or sold separately depending on the state and insurance carrier.\n\nOTHER COVERAGE TYPES\n\nPERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION COVERAGE (PIP or MEDEX):\nCovers within the specified limits, the medical, hospital and funeral expenses of the insured, others in his vehicles and pedestrians struck by him. The basic coverage for the insured's own injuries on a first-party basis, without regard to fault. It is only available in certain states. Depending on the state, the covered parties below and the amount of protection may vary.\n\nWho is covered?\n- Policyholder\n- Policyholder's relatives in the same household\n- Passengers\n- Other authorized drivers\n- Policyholder and family members if they are injured while riding in someone else's car or as a pedestrian when struck by another vehicle. (in some states)\n\nHow much protection does this coverage provide?\nTotal payments covered by PIP are the limits indicated. That is the maximum amount that will be paid per person for any combination of covered expenses (some states offer limits and others set it to an amount like $10,000). Specific limits and coverages vary by state.\n\nWho might benefit from buying additional medical coverage along with PIP?\nPeople who don't have health insurance that adequately covers the expenses listed above or people who carpool or frequently drive with passengers.\n\nRelated Coverage:\nAdditional Personal Injury Protection is available in some states where PIP is available; some carriers may offer Additional PIP. Additional Personal Injury Protection acts as a supplement to the PIP coverage required by your state.\nGuest Personal Injury Protection provides coverage to guest passengers in your vehicles. It is required when all drivers on your policy have rejected no-fault coverage (state of Kentucky).\n\nIn states like New Jersey, you have to choose a Personal Injury Protection Plan. Here is a description of those choices:\n Full PIP Primary- acts as the primary coverage for injuries sustained by you or your passengers in an auto accident.
